# Controlled Vocabularies for Ciência Vitae
This project aims to develop controlled vocabularies for Ciência Vitae using Linked Open Data (LOD) and SKOS. The goal is to structure and standardize academic data, promoting its interoperability and reuse by third parties.

# Project Description
Ciência Vitae is a national platform for academic curricula in Portugal that requires improved semantic interoperability to support integration with other data sources. As part of my thesis, this project proposes converting value lists from Ciência Vitae into controlled vocabularies, making them available as open and linked data.

# Technologies Used
SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System)

RDF (Resource Description Framework)

Linked Open Data (LOD)

# Project Structure
Identification and Analysis of Value Lists: The value lists used in Ciência Vitae were analyzed to identify terms that can be represented through controlled vocabularies.

Controlled Vocabulary Encoding: The vocabularies were encoded using the SKOS model, which allows hierarchical and machine-readable data structuring.

Vocabulary Publication: The vocabularies will be published in a triplestore, facilitating data query and reuse.
